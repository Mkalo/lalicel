Hello everyone its Kitty I know this is late but I've final finished porting the site to Jekyll so we now have a blog and a better way for managing content  

## What's new 

Well for one we have a blog and a **new** comment system and most of the site has been updated to improve load times and to make it easier to update the site but besides from that not much has changed yet remember this port to **jekyll** was to make it easier for me to redesign the site in the future and to have a way of alice to add new pages and content without having to touch any code.


I will continue to update the site when new bugs are discovered and will continue to work on the redesign which should be out in the next few months but i just wanted to get this done before anything else


Thanks for reading *Kitty*
