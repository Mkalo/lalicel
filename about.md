<h2>    A little about me </h2>

  <p>
    I'm a desginer, gamer, and fulltime streamer. I stream osu, photoshop, and sometimes league of legends. 
    I was born in Japan (Nagano, Toyoshina), but moved to Brazil when I was still a baby. I was in Brazil (switching between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo) Till about 10/11 years old. Then I moved to Massachusetts, USA and I still currently living there.

<h2>
  Top 5 biggest Interests
</h2><br />
<ul>
<li><p>
      Ever since I know myself for, I love horses, its silly but it is true. I never had a horse, but I had a big passion to see them and begged my mom to take me to places so I could ride them. I've won horse show jumps too. But now it is been years that I don't see any horses. Ever since I moved to USA I haven't ridden one. The only time was when I went back to Brazil to visit and searched for a horse there.
</p></li>
<li><p>      Aerial silks is also something I was really attached to for a few years. It is dangerous, scary, and requires a lot of straight. And since I am a pussy, I have no idea how I got into it. I could do basically everything on it. I was in an advanced stage. Also, been in some competitions
</p></li>
<li><p>
      Gaming is a huge interest. I started gaming at the age of 10. Became extremely addicted in a bad way as well. I started with Wizard101, Then Fiesta Online and then League of Legends. Taking them way too seriously and i still have that problem with League of legends. I can't play that game for fun only. And games are meant for that.
<li><p>

  Could not forget about Designing/drawing. I started drawing since I've been in school. I was always super quiet in school, and I liked to be myself and I felt like drawing was really enjoyable. Then when I grew older I was spending most of my day on the computer so I started doing art on photoshop. Not digitally drawing yet, but editing. Then I moved on to 3d sculpting. Used 3brush. And now I am getting started on drawing and painting digitally.

<li><p>
      And of course, Streaming is my biggest passion, Since I can do two of my biggest passions (gaming and drawing) while I interact with awesome people. I absolutely love my streaming community. They are so supportive and nice. That I can't be more grateful to have them there. They make me enjoy streaming to the fullest.
